Launch the command:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>
$> dotnet run ./XPLC/XPLC.atg -namespace XPLC -frames ./XPLC
</b>
<br/>
<br/>
 in order to generate Parse.cs and Scanner.cs for our XPLC compiler.
<br/>
After that two new files are created in the XPLC folder: Scanner.cs and Parser.cs that are the core of the XPLC compiler.
<br/>
