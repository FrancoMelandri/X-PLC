Once you have create dthe core files for the compiler (see the CoCo/src/ README.md file for instruaction) you are able to run the compiler.

First of all copy the files:

<b>
$> cp ../CoCo/src/XPLC/*.cs ./
</b>

and the run the command:

<b>
$> dotnet run hello.xplc
</b>

The output of the compilation phase should be a new file name <b>hello.xplc.xcomp </b> that represent the compiled script.
